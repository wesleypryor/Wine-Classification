## Wine-Classification
This is my project on Wine Classification for Data Mining 1. This project focused on supervised machine learning techniques to predict the types of wines, red or white, based on chemical composition. This project was completed in R with the following models:
- Decision Tress
- K Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines
- Artificial Neural Networks
